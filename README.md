Raster-to-Heatmap converts a data from a geographic raster file to a format that can be
displayed as a heatmap on an interactive map with the Google Maps API. This program takes
a raster file as an input, creates the heatmap data, styles the data with internal style
options, and creates a webpage displaying the heatmap. **NOTE:** webpages displaying rasters
with a large number of datapoints will be very slow to load.
